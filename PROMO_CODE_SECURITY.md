# Promo Code Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect the promo code system from various attack vectors and ensure data integrity.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. Client-Side Calculation Vulnerability

**Problem**: Discount calculations were performed on the client-side, making them vulnerable to manipulation.

**Solution**:

- Moved all discount calculations to server-side database functions
- Client-side calculations are only for display purposes
- Server validates provided discount amounts against calculated values

### 2. Missing Server-Side Validation

**Problem**: Booking creation didn't re-validate promo codes.

**Solution**:

- Added comprehensive validation in `create_full_booking_v2` database function
- Validates promo code existence, expiration, usage limits
- Calculates and verifies discount amounts server-side

### 3. Race Condition Vulnerability

**Problem**: Multiple users could use the same promo code simultaneously.

**Solution**:

- Implemented `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in database queries
- Added `reserve_promo_code` function for temporary reservations
- Atomic increment of `times_used` field

### 4. Missing Usage Tracking

**Problem**: Promo code usage wasn't properly tracked.

**Solution**:

- Automatic increment of `times_used` field in database function
- Validation against `max_uses` limit
- Proper error handling for exceeded limits

### 5. Insufficient Access Control

**Problem**: No proper access control for promo code management.

**Solution**:

- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Admin-only access for promo code management
- Service role permissions for system operations

## Implementation Details

### Database Functions

#### `create_full_booking_v2`

- Validates promo code existence and status
- Checks expiration dates and usage limits
- Calculates discounts server-side
- Verifies provided discount amounts
- Atomically increments usage counters
- Uses proper transaction isolation

#### `reserve_promo_code`

- Provides temporary reservation mechanism
- Uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for race condition prevention
- Returns promo data for client validation

### API Endpoints

#### `/api/validate-promo`

- Validates promo code without returning calculated amounts
- Performs basic validation checks
- Returns only validation status and promo metadata

#### `/api/reserve-promo`

- Reserves promo codes temporarily
- Prevents race conditions during booking process
- Returns reserved promo data

### Security Policies

#### Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- Only active promo codes are readable
CREATE POLICY "Allow reading active promo codes" ON promo_codes
    FOR SELECT
    USING (is_active = true);

-- Admin users can manage promo codes
CREATE POLICY "Allow admin users to manage promo codes" ON promo_codes
    FOR ALL
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM users
            WHERE users.id = auth.uid()
            AND users.role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
        )
    );
```

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Validation

- Server-side validation of all inputs
- Type checking and range validation
- Sanitization of promo codes (uppercase, trim)

### 2. Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Logging of security events

### 3. Rate Limiting

- Consider implementing rate limiting for promo validation
- Prevent brute force attacks on promo codes

### 4. Audit Trail

- Track promo code usage in database
- Log validation attempts and failures
- Monitor for suspicious patterns

## Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Rate Limiting

```typescript
// Implement rate limiting for promo validation
const rateLimit = {
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
};
```

### 2. Promo Code Complexity

- Use complex, randomly generated codes
- Implement minimum length requirements
- Consider using UUID-based codes

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting

- Monitor failed validation attempts
- Alert on unusual usage patterns
- Track promo code effectiveness

### 4. Backup and Recovery

- Regular backups of promo code data
- Recovery procedures for corrupted data
- Version control for promo code changes

## Testing Security Measures

### 1. Unit Tests

- Test discount calculation accuracy
- Validate promo code expiration logic
- Test usage limit enforcement

### 2. Integration Tests

- Test race condition scenarios
- Validate transaction rollback on errors
- Test concurrent promo code usage

### 3. Security Tests

- Test client-side manipulation attempts
- Validate server-side calculation integrity
- Test access control policies

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Regular Audits

- Review promo code usage patterns
- Check for suspicious activity
- Validate security policy effectiveness

### 2. Performance Monitoring

- Monitor database function performance
- Track API response times
- Monitor resource usage

### 3. Security Updates

- Regular security patches
- Update dependencies
- Review and update security policies

## Conclusion

The implemented security measures provide comprehensive protection against common promo code vulnerabilities:

- ✅ Server-side calculation and validation
- ✅ Race condition prevention
- ✅ Proper access control
- ✅ Usage tracking and limits
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Error handling and logging

These measures ensure the integrity of the promo code system while maintaining good user experience and system performance.
